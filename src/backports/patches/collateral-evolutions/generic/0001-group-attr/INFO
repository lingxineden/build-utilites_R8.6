The new attribute sysfs group was added via these commits:

mcgrof@ergon ~/linux (git::master)$ git describe --contains f2f37f58b
v3.11-rc2~18^2~9
mcgrof@ergon ~/linux (git::master)$ git describe --contains 3493f69f4
v3.11-rc2~18^2~2

We backport them with our own respective set of helpers. Each new data
structure that gets an attribute group needs a respective SmPL set of
rules for the transformation. We might be able to share the rules for
lookup / indexing between rules some how. These lookup reveal would
be used for inherent structural searches, pivots, if you will.

The changes that added the new APIs:

    sysfs.h: add ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() macro

    To make it easier for driver subsystems to work with attribute groups,
    create the ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS macro to remove some of the repetitive
    typing for the most common use for attribute groups.
