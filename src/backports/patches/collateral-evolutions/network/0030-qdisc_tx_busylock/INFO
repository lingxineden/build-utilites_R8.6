struct net_device got an extension with the member qdisc_tx_busylock
as of commit 23d3b8bfb. For older kernels we need to ifdef around that
as its now available.

    net: qdisc busylock needs lockdep annotations
    
    It seems we need to provide ability for stacked devices
    to use specific lock_class_key for sch->busylock
    
    We could instead default l2tpeth tx_queue_len to 0 (no qdisc), but
    a user might use a qdisc anyway.
    
    (So same fixes are probably needed on non LLTX stacked drivers)
