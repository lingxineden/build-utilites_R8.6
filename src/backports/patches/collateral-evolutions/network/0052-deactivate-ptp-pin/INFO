Programmable pins were introduced in the ptp subsystem in kernel 3.15 
and igb makes use of them now. These patches are removing the code 
accessing these new functions.

These patches are needed for every kernel which does not have this

    ptp: introduce programmable pins.
    
    This patch adds a pair of new ioctls to the PTP Hardware Clock device
    interface. Using the ioctls, user space programs can query each pin to
    find out its current function and also reprogram a different function
    if desired.
