Newer kernels make generic netlink ops and multicast groups
const, but older can't have that. We therefore introduce
__genl_const, which can be defined depending on the kernel.

What kernel versions require this?

XXX: try to SmPLify

The struct genl_ops gave the *option* to make it const via:
mcgrof@ergon ~/linux (git::master)$ git describe --contains f84f771d9
v3.13-rc1~33^2~32^2~2

The struct genl_multicast_group was *forced* to be const via:
mcgrof@ergon ~/linux (git::master)$ git describe --contains 2a94fe48f
v3.13-rc1~33^2^2
