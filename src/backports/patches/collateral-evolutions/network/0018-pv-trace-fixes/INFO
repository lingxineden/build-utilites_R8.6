In recent kernels, %pV will copy the va_list before using it.
This isn't true for all kernels, so copy the va_list for use
by the dev_*() functions, otherwise the kernel will crash if
the message is printed and traced.

This is required for kernels <= 3.1, as otherwise it would
those kernels would crash.
